This project is a simple calculator application built using Python's tkinter library. The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, along with the ability to clear inputs and compute results. The calculator's user interface (UI) is designed with a clean and simple layout using the ttk module for styling.
